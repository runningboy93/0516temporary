# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Ability to see versions of the code over time in the event of errors or needing to debug. Useful because you have a snapshot of the code at multiple times in history.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branch is a copy of the master code that is provided with the intent of merging back into the master code. You'd use a branch so that multiple people can be working on different parts of the project simultaneously and feeding branches back to the project manager so that he/she can approve and merge into the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is the last stage of formalizing changes to any segment of code in the project, following "git add." It "burns in" the changes that were made flagging the code as ready to be merged upon approval. A good commit message is clear and specific describing what was done to the code in that particular iteration.
